# ARTSEY.io - One Handed Keyboard Layout

I created and develop a one-handed system called [ARTSEY.io](http://artsey.io).

## What is ARTSEY?

Artsey is a one-handed keyboard system using 8 keys in a 2x4 layout. The system is designed to be easy to learn, comfortable to use, and fast enough for practical use.

## How does it work?

Artsey uses key combinations to type most of the letters, numbers, symbols, and functions available on a full-sized keyboard.

## What is it for?

It is for people of all abilities and for any application. I personally use it to take notes while I walk or for a pocketable hardware keyboard to use with my phone.
