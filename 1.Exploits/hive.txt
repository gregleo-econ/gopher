### Announcing HIVE: Integrated Experimental Economics Research Platform ###

HIVE (Highly Integrated Virtual Environment) is an all-encompassing online research platform for Experimental Economics. At its core, HIVE comprises a dedicated web application, offering an array of features that enhance the research process. HIVE will provide researchers with the tools to recruit and pay participants from a shared subject pool, pre-register hypotheses, and seamlessly program and deploy experiments. HIVE will foster collaboration and promote knowledge sharing by serving as a hub for discovering experimental code, and accessing data generated on the platform with the ability to link subjects anonymously across experiments.
