This odd looking device is a QAZ Personal Terminal. It is a computer I have been working on as a long-term project over the last year and finally finished in September.  

The build was recently feaured on the hackaday website: Hackaday Article (Link: https://hackaday.com/2022/10/22/2022-cyberdeck-contest-qaz-personal-terminal/)
