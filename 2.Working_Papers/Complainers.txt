### Complainer's Dilemma ###

## Abstract ##

Technological innovations have made complaining easier than ever. Often, where it is easy to complain, only problems meeting some large threshold of complaints are addressed. In this paper, I model the strategic environment facing complainers and demonstrate that properties of the resulting games' equilibria justify the existence of high complaint thresholds. By setting the thresholds appropriately, an administrator can prevent complaints that are not worth addressing. Furthermore, leveraging novel results that rely on a transcendental function known as Lambert-W, I demonstrate that policies minimizing the cost of complaining while requiring a large threshold are universally more efficient for large constituencies.
