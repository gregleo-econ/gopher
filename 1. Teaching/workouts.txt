## Shape of Functions

- When is $\left(\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{y}\right)^\alpha$ quasiconcave on $(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^2_{>0}$?

- Prove $\left(1+\frac{1}{x}\right)^{x}$ is monotone on $x\in\mathbb{R}_{>0}$.

- Prove $\prod_i^n\left(x_i^{\alpha_i}\right)$ is quasiconcave.

## Misc

- Show there is no smooth profit function where profit and average profit are both maximized at the same interior point $(q>0)$ and where profit is strictly positive $(\pi > 0)$. Construct a discontinuous profit function where there is such an interior optimum.
