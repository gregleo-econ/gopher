## Intro ##

This is the course website for Vanderbilt Economics 3012. This course focuses on the formal analysis of the behavior of individuals and firms and how these behaviors aggregate in a market. We will analyze market performance and determine how performance is influenced by various changes. This page will be continuously updated throughout the semester. Please check it on a regular basis.

## Mathematical Level ##

Some concepts and formulas from differential calculus will be used, but most of the presentations, homework and exams will involve diagrams, algebra and analytic reasoning. A review of the relevant mathematical concepts will occur on the first day of class.

## Problem Sets ##

Problem sets will consist of selections from problems in the workouts book, as well as problems I have written. The problem sets will be posted on this page in the schedule below. I encourage working on the homework in groups. The homework will be graded by the teaching assistant.

## Exams and Grading ##

There will be one midterm and a final exam. They are tentatively placed in the schedule below. Grading will be based 30% on midterm exam, 50% on the final exam, and 20% on homework.
