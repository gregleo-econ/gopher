## General Info ##

This is the course website for Vanderbilt Economics 3012. This page will be continuously updated throughout the semester. Please check it regularly.   

3012 focuses on the formal analysis of the behavior of individuals and firms* and how these behaviors aggregate in *markets.  We will analyze market performance and determine how performance is influenced by various changes.  


Some concepts and formulas from differential calculus will be used, but most of the presentations, homework, and exams will involve diagrams, algebra and analytic reasoning. I emphasize intuition and deep understand over the mechanical process of solving problems.  

There will be one midterm and a final exam. They are tentatively placed in the schedule below. Grading will be based 30% on the midterm exam, 50% on the final exam, and 20% on homework.  

The TA for this course is Qiao Lin.  
Qiao's office hours: TBA in TBA.  
Greg's office hours: TBA in TBA.  

## Course Notes / Textbook ##

The “official” textbook for this course is Hal Varian's Intermediate Microeconomics with Calculus: A Modern Approach (Link: https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393689983). Any edition of this textbook should be fine. You will also need a copy of the Workouts in Intermediate Microeconomics (Link: https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393922615). I recommend the latest edition of this book since that is the problem numbering I will use in the problem sets. 

The “unofficial” textbook for this course are my class notes. These can either complement or replace the textbook.

## Problem Sets ##

Problem sets will consist of selections from problems in the workouts book, as well as problems I have written. I encourage working on the homework in groups. The homework will be graded by the teaching assistant. I will add the due dates below as we move through the semester.
