## Textbook (Last Updated 8/27/24) ##

The Class Notes (Link: ../files/4998/4998_Notes.pdf) are the official textbook for the course. I will update it throughout the semester. 

## Description ##

This course is designed to explore the concepts of efficiency and fairness in both market and non-market settings. We will start by examining core principles such as optimization, ordinal relations, utility, and measures of efficiency and fairness to build a strong foundation. Next, we will analyze simple exchange markets, their successes and failures, and see how property rights can help address market inefficiencies. We will then shift focus to non-market collective decisions, addressing the challenges of achieving efficiency and fairness in public goods and common resource problems. Additionally, we will explore how imperfect information exacerbates these issues and discuss potential solutions.

The course emphasizes intuitive understanding and practical application of economic theory. You will engage with a variety models to see how economic tools can tackle problems of efficiency and fairness in public economics. This course will challenge you to think critically about the role of economists in shaping public policy, societal outcomes, and collective decision-making, providing insight into how economic theory can inform real-world decisions and actions.

## Mathematical Rigor  ##

The only mathematical pre-requisite for this course is multivariate calculus. I will draw on tools from other areas of mathematics, but I will introduce these tools to you as we learn. I emphasize intuition and deep understand over the mechanical process of solving problems.  

## Grading  ##

There will be one midterm and a final exam. They are tentatively placed in the schedule below. Grading will be based 30% on the midterm exam, 50% on the final exam, and 20% on homework.
