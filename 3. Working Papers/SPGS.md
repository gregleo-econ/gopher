## Abstract

We analyze a dynamic coalition formation game of perfect information
where players can each make a (finite) number of offers to other players to form
coalitions. We show that there is a class of no-delay subgame perfect equilibria where
the outcomes are individually rational and Pareto optimal, and we provide sufficient
conditions for equilibrium to implement core coalition structures.
