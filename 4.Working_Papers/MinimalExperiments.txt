## Abstract ##

Given a parameterized model of preferences, what choice data or experiment would identify an agent’s parameter value in that model? Similarly, what data would be sufficient for testing definitely whether an agent is consistent with the model? We identify a method for finding experiments that will either classify or test a given model. We do so using a novel graph-theoretic construction: The labeled permutohedron. We then provide an algorithm that finds the “smallest” such experiment for any model.
