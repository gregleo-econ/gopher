## Chocolate Flavors 1/18/22 @tidytuesday

This week's [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) data is a record of chocolate ratings. I created a simple Shiny App that provides a text description of chocolates in a certain cocoa percentage range. For instance:

``Chocolates with cocoa percentage ranging from 85% to 100% are most often described as: bitter, spicy, earthy, intense, and mild-bitter. They most often originate from: Blended Origins, Ecuador, and Belize.``

## Flight of the Bumblebees 1/10/22 @tidytuesday

[Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) is a weekly data science "challenge" for the R community. This week's dataset tracks bee colonies in the US over the past few years.  

This week, I made an R Shiny web app that converts data on the number of colonies in each state into a song. My favorite state is listen to is Georgia (my home state). When played fast enough, these little songs sound vaguely like [Flight of the Bumblebee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M93qXQWaBdE).

[The app can be found here](https://g-econ.shinyapps.io/Flight_of_the_Bumblebees). 

*At the moment it does not work on iphone, but has been tested on windows, linux, and android.*

## Code Golf Abundant Numbers 11/15/21 @codegolf

The goal in *code golf* is to produce a program that solves a problem with as few characters as possible. Here is a code golf problem where R does pretty well.

### Abundant Numbers

This problem comes from [Here](<https://code.golf/abundant-numbers>](https://code.golf/abundant-numbers).

*An abundant number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors (divisors not including the number itself) is greater than the number itself. For example **12** is abundant because its proper divisors are **1**, **2**, **3**, **4**, and **6** which add up to **16**.*

*Print all the abundant numbers from **1** to **200** inclusive, each on their own line.*

### Code: (46 Characters)

This code takes advantage of R's matrix functions and operators.

```{r abundant}
a=1:200
t(t(a[((!outer(a,a,"%%"))%*%a)>=2*a]))
```
