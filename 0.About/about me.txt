I am Greg Leo. I work at Vanderbilt University as an Assistant Professor of Economics. I got my PhD from the University of California, Santa Barbara. I work on microeconomic theory and experimental economics. I like to cycle, speed skate, and make things. 

## About This Webpage ##

I generate this site from a directory of markdown files using a script written in R. The markdown is converted to html using some regex nonsense. When I push the markdown files to Github (Link: https://github.com/), a virtual machine automatically runs my script to convert the markdown to html and then pushes the resulting html files to a separate Github pages (Link: https://pages.github.com/) repository for hosting.

The code and some instructions for setting up your own site like this are available on my R Static Site Generator (Link: https://github.com/gregleo-econ/R-Site-Generator) repository.
