## About This Webpage ##

I generate this site from a directory of markdown files using a script written in R. When I push the markdown files to Github (Link: https://github.com/), a “github action” automatically runs my R script to convert the markdown to html and then pushed the resulting html files to a separate Github pages (Link: https://pages.github.com/) repository.  

The code and some instructions for setting up your own site like this are available on my R Static Site Generator (Link: https://github.com/gregleo-econ/R-Site-Generator) repository.
