### About Me ###

I am Greg Leo. I am a designer, developer, and economist. My keyboard layout known as "QAZ" is among the most popular ultra-small mechanical keyboards among enthusiasts. I am also the creator of the ARTSEY.IO (Link: http://artsey.io) one-handed typing system. I do full-stack development in the R language, with a focus on apps for academia. I teach microeconomics at Vanderbilt University and conduct research in microeconomic theory and experimental economics. I am also an accomplished cyclist and former competitive freediver.  

## About This Webpage ##

I generate this site from a directory of markdown files using a script written in R. The markdown is converted to html using some regex nonsense. When I push the markdown files to Github (Link: https://github.com/), a virtual machine automatically runs my script to convert the markdown to html and then pushes the resulting html files to a separate Github pages (Link: https://pages.github.com/) repository for hosting.

The code and some instructions for setting up your own site like this are available on my R Static Site Generator (Link: https://github.com/gregleo-econ/R-Site-Generator) repository.
