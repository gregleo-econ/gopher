## Intro ##

This is the course website for Vanderbilt Economics 8100. This is the first course of the PhD microeconomics core sequence. The course will cover the fundamentals of consumer theory, theory of the firm, and simple markets in partial equilibrium. This page will be continuously updated throughout the semester. Please check it on a regular basis. 

## Textbook ##

Main textbook: Advanced Microeconomic Theory (Link: https://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Microeconomic-Theory-Geoffrey-Jehle/dp/0273731912), Geoffrey Jehle and Philip Reny.  
Secondary textbook: Microeconomic Theory (Link: https://www.amazon.com/Microeconomic-Theory-Andreu-Mas-Colell/dp/0195073401), Andreu Mas-Colell, Michael D. Whinston, Jerry R. Green.

## Problem Sets ##

There will be an assignment roughly each week. Problems will be added to the schedule about two weeks before the assignment is due. You must type your homework. This is the perfect time for you to learn to type in LaTeX. There are many online resources (Link: https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/latex/) for learning LaTeX. One particularly easy way to get started with LaTeX is through the very user-friendly editor called Lyx (Link: lyx.org). There will be a learning curve at first. Embrace it. This is an investment.

## Class ##
