### Econ 3012 ###

This is the course website for Vanderbilt Economics 3012. This page will be continuously updated throughout the semester. Please check it regularly.   

3012 focuses on the formal* analysis of the *behavior of individuals and firms and how they interact.   

Some concepts and formulas from differential calculus will be used. I emphasize intuition and deep understand over the mechanical process of solving problems.  

There will be one midterm and a final exam. They are tentatively placed in the schedule below. Grading will be based 30% on the midterm exam, 50% on the final exam, and 20% on homework.  

Class meets 8:40-9:55 (Or Whatever) in Furman.  

The TA for this course is Yuhan Chen--

## Textbook ##

You will need a copy of the Workouts in Intermediate Microeconomics (Link: https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393922615).  
Please get the latest edition of this book since that is the problem numbering I will use in the problem sets.  

The class notes below are the official textbook for the course.  
Hal Varian's Intermediate Microeconomics with Calculus: A Modern Approach (Link: https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393689983) covers very similar material if you want a supplementary textbook. Any edition of this textbook should be fine. 

## Class Notes  ##

These class notes are a polished version of what I cover in class.
