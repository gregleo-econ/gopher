### Econ 3012 ###

This is the course website for Vanderbilt Economics 3012. This page will be continuously updated throughout the semester. Please check it regularly.   

3012 focuses on the formal analysis of the behavior of individuals and firms* and how these behaviors aggregate in *markets.  We will analyze market performance and determine how performance is influenced by various changes.  

Some concepts and formulas from differential calculus will be used, but most of the presentations, homework, and exams will involve diagrams, algebra and analytic reasoning. I emphasize intuition and deep understand over the mechanical process of solving problems.  

There will be one midterm and a final exam. They are tentatively placed in the schedule below. Grading will be based 30% on the midterm exam, 50% on the final exam, and 20% on homework.  

Class meets T,TH 1:15-2:30 in Wilson Hall 103.  

The TA for this course is Qiao Lin--

## Textbook ##

The official textbook for this course is Hal Varian's Intermediate Microeconomics with Calculus: A Modern Approach (Link: https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393689983). Any edition of this textbook should be fine. You will also need a copy of the Workouts in Intermediate Microeconomics (Link: https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393922615). I recommend the latest edition of this book since that is the problem numbering I will use in the problem sets. 


## Class Notes  ##

These class notes are a polished version of what I cover in class.
